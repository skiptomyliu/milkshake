Milkshake is a Mac OS X [Pandora](https://www.pandora.com) client.

If you don't have a Pandora account, you can [sign up here](https://www.pandora.com/account/register)

# Download v0.0.1 (Pre-release)
[.DMG Installer](/app/Milkshake.dmg)

[.ZIP download](/app/Milkshake.zip)

# Important note
This client isn't a full Pandora replacement and hasn't been fully tested on the free version.  This client doesn't support creating playlists, you'll still need to create them on [pandora.com](https://www.pandora.com) before seeing it on Milkshake.

# Features
  - Minimalist UI that focuses on album art
  - Shortcuts
  - Cross fading
  - Keep player as front window
  - Easy navigation

# Shortcuts
Keys | Action 
--- | --- | 
^⌘]  | next song 
^⌘[  | previous song
^⌘P | pause song
^⌘R | repeat song
^⌘+| thumb up
^⌘-| thumb down 

If you want to modify the shortcuts, you can modify it in [AppDelegate.swift](https://github.com/skiptomyliu/milkshake/blob/master/Milkshake/AppDelegate.swift#L50-L113) and re-compile.  I haven't had time to overwrite the keyboard media keys.
